# A minecraft mod which aims to add a "second player" into the game which will actually be intelligent.

## Ever felt lonely while playing minecraft alone during that two-week phase? Well, this mod aims to solve that problem of loneliness, not just catering to this particular use case, but even (hopefully in the future) to play in multiplayer servers as well.

This mod relies on the internal code of the Carpet mod, please star the repository of the mod: https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet (Giving credit where it's due)
